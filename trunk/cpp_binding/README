DISCLAIMER: WORK IN PROGRESS
The system was successfully built and tested on MacOSX Lion and Red Hat Enterprise 6.2

TODO:
- streamline the automatic building process for all supported systems
- get shared library working for Mac and Windows

* What's in this folder? *
**************************

SBGN C++ binder: sbgn.cxx and sbgn.hxx - Generated files
----------------
- automatically generated from ../resources/SBGN.xsd
- using http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/

Code using the binder: sbgn2txt.cxx
----------------------
- in = some *.sbgn files
- out = a text description (or validation errors, if any)

Tools to generate the binder: makefile, and a local installation of the XSD converter [!] NOT INCLUDED
-----------------------------
- "make libsbgn.a" generates sbgn.cxx and sbgn.hxx from the current XSD and compiles to a static library
- "make test" compiles and runs sbgn2txt on all *.sbgn files in ../test-files
- "make install" installs the library and header files at a configurable location.
- "make libsbgn.so" creates a shared library that can be installed using "make install". Linux/Unix only at the moment.

********************************
* How to (re)build the binder? *
********************************

Instructions for Linux / Mac OS X:
====================================

sbgn.hxx and sbgn.cxx are generated automatically from SBGN.xsd.
To stay up-to-date with the latest specifications, these files should be rebuilt whenever the xsd is modified.

Step 0
++++++

- Download the correct version of the conversion tool for your platform from http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/download.xhtml
- Uncompress the downloaded file in the current directory.
We'll call the resulting directory XSD2CPP in the following instructions.

Step 1
++++++

Make sure the conversion tool works properly on your system:
	cd XSD2CPP/examples/cxx/tree/hello
	make
If not, consult the tool's documentation to fix the problem (cf. XSD2CPP/documentation)

Step 2
++++++

- Modify the configuration section of the makefile to suitable file locations (documented in makefile itself).

- Use "make" to update the binder against the latest version of the XSD, and create a static library.

Step 3
++++++

- Execute "make test" to run tests against all the test files

Step 4
++++++

- Make sure the PREFIX variable is set to the appropriate location for installation.

- Execute "make install" to install the library and header files.

Optional Step for Linux/Unix only
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Create a shared library my executing "make libsbgn.so".

- To install this follow Step 4 above.


****************************
* How to reuse the binder? *
****************************

To use the library you need the following:

Headers:
- sbgn.hxx
- headers provided by the codesynthesis package located in $XSD2CPP/libxsd

Libraries:
- libxerces-c 3.1
- libsbgn  (static or shared library)

Refer to the sbgn2txt makefile target for an examples of how to compile the library in your own code.
