DISCLAIMER: WORK IN PROGRESS
The system was successfully built and tested on MacOSX Snow Leopard

TODO:
- streamline the automatic building process for all supported systems
- package the resulting files as a standalone library

**************************
* What's in this folder? *
**************************

SBGN C++ binder: sbgn.cxx and sbgn.hxx [!] FOR REFERENCE ONLY, MAY NOT BE UP-TO-DATE
----------------
- automatically generated from ../resources/SBGN.xsd
- using http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/

Code using the binder: sbgn2txt.cxx
----------------------
- in = some *.sbgn files
- out = a text description (or validation errors, if any)

Tools to generate the binder: makefile, and a local installation of the XSD converter [!] NOT INCLUDED
-----------------------------
- "make libsbgn" generates sbgn.cxx and sbgn.hxx from the current XSD
- "make test" compiles and runs sbgn2txt on all *.sbgn files in ../test-files

********************************
* How to (re)build the binder? *
********************************

sbgn.hxx and sbgn.cxx are generated automatically from SBGN.xsd.
To stay up-to-date with the latest specifications, these files should be rebuilt whenever the xsd is modified.

Step 0
++++++

- Download the correct version of the conversion tool for your platform from http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/download.xhtml
- Uncompress the downloaded file in the current directory.
We'll call the resulting directory XSD2CPP in the following instructions.

Step 1
++++++

Make sure the conversion tool works properly on your system:
	cd XSD2CPP/examples/cxx/tree/hello
	make
If not, consult the tool's documentation to fix the problem (cf. XSD2CPP/documentation)

Step 2
++++++

- Modify the first line of the makefile to link to the correct root directory:
	root := ./XSD2CPP/examples
- Use "make" to update the binder against the latest version of the XSD, and run tests against all the test files.

****************************
* How to reuse the binder? *
****************************

In order to reuse sbgn.hxx and sbgn.cxx in your own project, you need to be able to link to a copy of libxsd (cf. XSD2CPP/libxsd)
For building and linking options (dependencies, system specific settings, etc.), have a look at XSD2CPP/examples/build
Refer to sbgn2txt.cxx for examples of how to invoke the library in your own code.
